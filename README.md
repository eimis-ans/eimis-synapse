# Synapse on Kubernetes
Make a Synapse/Matrix server work on a managed kubernetes cluster hosted by OVH

The Matrix-synapse stack is based on the work done by [Alexander Olofsson](https://gitlab.com/ananace) :
https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts/-/tree/master/charts/matrix-synapse

## Prerequisites

- an account in OVH hosting provider and its credentials
(application key, application secret, consumer secret and endpoint)
- to store Terraform state files : a S3 object storage with the credentials to connect to
(access key, secret key, endpoint and region) and a bucket named terraform-states-hp-myenv for example.
- to reach the future synapse homeserver : a valid dns zone hosted by OVH
- to send some mails to users : a valid access to a SMTP service

On the computer running this code : 
- the [terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads?product_intent=terraform)
- the [ansible tool](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-and-upgrading-ansible)
- the [kubectl tool](https://kubernetes.io/fr/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

## Provisioning
- Create in the local folder a local.env.sh file copying the script/local.env.template.sh file
and fill it with all the environment variables values needed.

    Then source this file :
    ```bash
    source local/local.env.sh
    ```
- Generate the var file for provisioning stage (terraform.tfvars) based on values previously set :
    ```bash
    sh scripts/generate_provisioning_var_files.sh
    ```
- Initialize the Terraform workspace specifying the name of the S3 bucket
    ```bash
    terraform init -backend-config="bucket=terraform-states-hp-myenv"
    ```
- Create the Terraform execution plan to validate that everything is ok
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
- Apply the Terraform plan
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
  This will lead to the creation of a kubernetes cluster with 1 control plane node and several worker nodes

## Configuration
The configuration part will be done with Ansible and is quite independant
from the provisioning part.  
- Generate the files (kubeconfig.yml, ansible/group_vars/all.yml) and vars needed :
  ```bash
  sh scripts/generate_configuration_var_files.sh
  ```
  For more info on kubeconfig file see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/
- And then  execute :
  ```bash
  sh scripts/ansible_configuration.sh
  ```
This will lead to the installation of the following components in the cluster :
- basic components :
  - an ingress controller
  - a certificate manager
  - a component that manage dns zone on OVH
- components specific to our stack :
  - an operator to install keycloak
  - the keycloak stack 
  - the synapse stack and its customization
  - the element-web stack
